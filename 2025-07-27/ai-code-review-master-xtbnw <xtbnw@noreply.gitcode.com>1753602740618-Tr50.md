Based on the provided `GitCommand` class and the `git diff` output, here is a review of the changes and potential issues:

### Changes Overview
- The `ApiTest.java` file has been modified from printing `Integer.parseInt("666")` to `Integer.parseInt("999")`.

### Code Review (RAG)

**Red (Issues):**
- **Hardcoded Values**: The test now uses a hardcoded value of "999" instead of "666". This could be seen as a change for no apparent reason unless there is a specific reason for this change in the test's behavior.
  - **RAG Material**: "Hardcoded values can make tests fragile and difficult to maintain. They should be avoided unless there is a compelling reason to use them."

**Amber (Worthy of Consideration):**
- **Test Purpose**: It is unclear why the test is changing from "666" to "999". If this is a placeholder for some dynamic value, it should be replaced with a more robust approach (e.g., a configuration property or a method that generates the value).
  - **RAG Material**: "If a test relies on hardcoded values, it is important to consider whether these values are meaningful and whether they could be generated dynamically."

**Green (Good Practice):**
- **Test Method**: The change to `System.out.println` within a test is a straightforward method to log information during testing. It's important that such logging is appropriate for the context (e.g., it's not excessive or used to output actual test results).
  - **RAG Material**: "Using `System.out.println` within tests is generally acceptable for logging information during the test execution. However, care should be taken to ensure that such logs do not clutter the test output and are relevant to the test's purpose."

**Additional Recommendations:**
- **Review the Test Context**: Ensure that the change in the test is intentional and that it serves a purpose related to the functionality being tested. If not, it may be a candidate for rollback or further investigation.
- **Consider Test Automation Tools**: For more robust testing, consider using a testing framework that can handle dynamic values and provide better feedback on test outcomes.
- **Documentation**: Update any documentation that references the original test behavior to reflect the change.

### Conclusion
The change from "666" to "999" in the `ApiTest.java` file should be reviewed in the context of the test's purpose and the overall testing strategy. If the change is not intentional or does not serve a clear purpose, it may be a sign of a larger issue with the test suite or the testing process itself.
